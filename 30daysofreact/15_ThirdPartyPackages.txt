// 30 Days Of React:Third Party Packages

// Third Party Packages
// There are more than 1.4M JavaScript packages on npm registry. By now there is a package almost for every kind of problem. 
// We do not have to create the wheel instead we have to know how to use the wheel. In this section, we will learn how to use npm packages and also we will implement most common package for React applications. 
// As of October 10, 2020, the npm registry popular packages, total number of packages, downloads per week and downloads per month seems as shown below.

// In one way or the other you many need the following packages in your React applications. Specially node-sass, moment and axios are important for some projects.

// node-sass
// moment
// axios
// react-icons
// styled-components
// reactstrap
// lodash
// uuid

// NPM or Yarn
// You can use either npm or yarn to install packages. If you want to use yarn you have install it separately. I would recommend you to stick in one of the package. Don't use both package management tools in one application at the same time.

// Let's see how to install packages to an application. First, we go to the project directory and write the following command.

// // syntax, we can use i or install
// npm i package-name
// // or
// yarn add package-name

// node-sass
// Sass is a CSS preprocess which allows to write CSS function, nesting and many more. 
// Let's install node-sass to make use of the power of Sass.

// Using npm:
// MINGW64 ~/Desktop/30-days-of-react$ npm install node-sass

// Using yarn:
// MINGW64 ~/Desktop/30-days-of-react$ yarn add node-sass

// After installing node-sass you can start using Sass in React. Create a styles folder and inside this folder create test.scss. 
// Import this file to the component you are working or index.js. You don't need import the node-sass to the component.
