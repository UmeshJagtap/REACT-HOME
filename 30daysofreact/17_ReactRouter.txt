30 Days Of React: React Router

What is React Router ?
You may have not heard of the word route or router before and it might be necessary to define it here. The literal meaning of route is a path or a way to get to somewhere. 
The meaning in React is also similar to the literal meaning. React Router is by itself a React component which allows you to navigate between React components.

In this section, you will get started how to use React router but it may not have plenty of information about it. 
In case you prefer to learn from the official website of React Router you can get here.

As we have cleared out the very beginning that React is a single page application which has only one index.html page in the entire application. 
When we implement a React Router the different components get render on the index.html page at same time or different time base on different logic and conditions. 
React Router has different versions and the latest version is React Router 5. We will use React Router version 4 for this challenge. Let's get started by installing the React Router packages.
